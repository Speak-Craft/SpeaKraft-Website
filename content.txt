Several research efforts have been carried out in recent
years to enhance public speaking and presentation skills using
technology. However, most existing solutions remain limited
in scope, often focusing on only a single aspect of delivery
rather than providing comprehensive and personalized
feedback. For instance, some platforms are designed to
provide only general advice or delayed analysis, which does
not capture the real challenges faced by learners [7]. Such
systems often fail to address critical aspects of presentation
delivery, such as filler word usage, time management, pacing,
loudness control, and non-verbal expressions, all of which are
essential components of effective communication.
SPEAKRAFT addresses these gaps by providing an
integrated training platform that delivers both immediate
and post-analysis feedback, ensuring a holistic learning
experience for its users.
One of the most important and unique aspects of our work
is its focus on Sri Lankan undergraduates as the primary
target group. Presentation skills are central to academic and
professional success for university students, yet existing tools
are not designed to handle the accentual variations of Sri
Lankan learners. Most available solutions are trained on
international datasets, making it difficult for them to
accurately recognize speech patterns, filler words, or
emotional cues from local speakers [8]. To overcome this
limitation, we did not rely on pre-existing datasets. Instead,
we collected data directly from undergraduates of different
universities across Sri Lanka and performed manual labeling
to ensure accuracy. This approach makes SPEAKRAFT
highly relevant and unique, as it provides tailored feedback
suited to the communication style and challenges faced by Sri
Lankan learners.
Filler word detection represents another critical
component of our system. While prior research has
acknowledged the negative effects of filler words such as
“um”
, “ah”
, “like”
, “you know” and similar expressions,
very few existing tools provide targeted mechanisms to reduce
them [9]. Excessive filler word usage can diminish clarity,
reduce credibility, and disrupt the overall flow of speech,
particularly in academic presentations [10]. Using feature
extraction techniques such as MFCCs combined with machine
learning classifiers, SPEAKRAFT identifies filler words,
provides speakers with reports, and provide structured
exercises for practice. This ensures that students not only
become aware of their filler word patterns but also learn
practical strategies to reduce them over time with progress
tracking.
Another area where existing solutions show limitations is
in evaluating loudness variations. Research in acoustic
modeling highlights the importance of analyzing loudness and
clarity at the word or sentence level, as proper vocal projection
plays a major role in keeping audiences engaged [11] [12].
Despite this, most platforms fail to provide actionable
feedback on this aspect. SPEAKRAFT incorporates loudness
tracking across an entire presentation and provides
personalized exercises aimed at improving vocal control and
projection, making the training process both comprehensive
and practical.
In addition, speech pacing is a key challenge for many
learners [13] [14]. While prior experiments using words-per-
minute (WPM) analysis and MFCC features have shown
potential in identifying unusually slow or fast speaking rates,
they often fail to account for natural pauses, breathing
patterns, and rhythm. This results in incomplete feedback for
speakers. To overcome this, SPEAKRAFT integrates real-
time pace monitoring with pause detection, allowing users to
balance fluency, rhythm, and clarity during delivery.
Non-verbal communication has also received attention in
prior studies, with research confirming the importance of
facial expressions, micro-expressions, and emotional cues in
effective presentations [15] [16]. Advances in affective
computing and facial emotion recognition technologies, such
as OpenCV and DeepFace, have made it possible to analyze
these aspects. Yet, such methods are rarely applied to
presentation training platforms. SPEAKRAFT integrates
these techniques into its framework, providing immediate,
emotion-sensitive feedback that helps learners become more
expressive, confident, and engaging speakers.
Taken together, previous studies have made important
contributions to speech analysis, pacing, and emotion
recognition [17]. However, limitations remain in
personalization, multimodal integration, and practical
exercises for Sri Lankan Undergraduates [18]. SPEAKRAFT
is specifically designed to overcome these challenges by
combining filler word detection, loudness monitoring,
speech pacing analysis, and facial expression recognition
into a single, integrated framework tailored to Sri Lankan
undergraduates. By leveraging a manually collected and
labeled local dataset, SPEAKRAFT offers accuracy and
cultural relevance that existing international solutions cannot
provide. Through its real-time feedback and structured
training activities, the platform creates a comprehensive and
interactive environment, empowering undergraduates to
develop stronger, clearer, and more confident presentation
skills that directly support their academic and professional
success.

background literature
Existing research highlights the importance of effective presentation skills as a core
competency in higher education, with numerous studies linking strong communication
abilities to improved academic performance and employability. Traditional training
methods often rely on lecturer or peer feedback, which, while valuable, can be
inconsistent, subjective, and difficult to scale for large student cohorts. Recent advances
in AI-driven communication training, such as speech recognition and facial expression
analysis tools, have demonstrated promise in providing automated, data-driven feedback.
However, most of these systems are developed in Western contexts and face significant
limitations when applied to Asian learners, particularly due to challenges in accent
recognition and cultural adaptation. This gap in localized, intelligent training tools
underscores the need for tailored solutions like SPEAKRAFT, which integrates
multimodal AI to address both linguistic and cultural nuances of Sri Lankan
undergraduates.
Presentation Skills in Educational Contexts
Presentation skills have long been recognized as a core competency in undergraduate
education, directly influencing academic performance, employability, and professional
success. Effective oral communication contributes not only to knowledge transfer but also
to critical thinking, confidence building, and leadership development. However,
numerous studies have highlighted persistent challenges faced by students, including
performance anxiety, lack of structured guidance, and limited access to consistent
feedback during practice. In the Sri Lankan context, these issues are further compounded
3
by traditional classroom approaches that emphasize content delivery over communication
training, leaving many undergraduates underprepared for academic and workplace
presentations.
Global Approaches to AI-Assisted Communication Training
In recent years, AI-powered solutions for communication training have gained
prominence. Platforms such as Orai, Yoodli, and VirtualSpeech employ natural language
processing (NLP) and speech recognition to evaluate aspects such as speech clarity,
pacing, filler word usage, and confidence levels. Similarly, emotion detection tools using
facial recognition and affective computing provide insights into non-verbal
communication. These systems have demonstrated effectiveness in improving learners’
delivery through data-driven, personalized feedback. However, most of these applications
are designed for Western contexts, primarily recognizing American or British English
accents, which limits their adaptability for Asian learners.
Challenges in Local Context
While global AI-based communication trainers offer robust features for analyzing speech
pace, their effectiveness is limited when applied to Sri Lankan learners. Most of these
tools are designed and trained on datasets featuring American or British English accents,
making them less accurate in recognizing local pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm
patterns. This results in transcription errors, misinterpretation of pause durations, and
inaccurate pacing metrics.
Additionally, these systems often fail to account for culturally specific speech patterns,
including common hesitations, filler words, and rhythmic variations typical in Sri Lankan
English. Consequently, learners receive feedback that is sometimes irrelevant or
misleading, reducing the practical value of the training. Such limitations highlight the
need for localized AI models capable of accurately assessing speech pace within the
linguistic and cultural context of Sri Lankan undergraduates, ensuring meaningful and
actionable feedback.
Technological Solutions in Presentation skills Training
Advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in speech recognition and computer
vision, provide an opportunity to design intelligent, localized presentation trainers.

Whisper API, for example, has shown promise in recognizing diverse accents with greater
accuracy, while OpenCV and DeepFace frameworks enable real-time tracking of facial
expressions and emotional cues. These technologies can be combined with interactive
web platforms to deliver multimodal feedback covering both verbal and non-verbal
aspects of communication. By integrating features such as filler word detection, pace
management, loudness monitoring, and emotion analysis, an AI-powered system can
offer holistic training tailored to Sri Lankan learners.
Motivation for SPEAKRAFT
To address the limitations of existing systems and meet the unique needs of Sri Lankan
undergraduates, this research introduces SPEAKRAFT, an AI-powered virtual trainer
specifically designed for presentation skill development. Unlike Western-centric
platforms, SPEAKRAFT is tailored to handle local linguistic and cultural contexts while
offering real-time, personalized coaching. The system integrates four core components
that together provide a comprehensive training environment:
• Filler Word Detection and Time Management: Frequent reliance on filler
words such as “um” and “ah” often disrupts the fluency of presentations.
SPEAKRAFT detects these instances in real time and provides a quantitative
measure of usage. Alongside this, the system incorporates time management tools,
helping students allocate speaking time across sections of their presentation and
avoid rushing or exceeding allotted durations.
• Detection of Incomplete Words and Loudness Variation: Many students
struggle with clarity in pronunciation, often leaving words incomplete or speaking
at inconsistent volume levels. SPEAKRAFT identifies incomplete word patterns
and monitors vocal loudness, offering targeted feedback to maintain clarity,
audibility, and consistent delivery throughout the speech.
• Speech Pace Management: Speaking too quickly can overwhelm audiences,
while slow pacing can reduce engagement. By analyzing speech rate, pauses and
other features, SPEAKRAFT guides students to maintain an optimal pace,
providing visual indicators and practice exercises that enhance audience
comprehension and attention.
• Facial Expression Analysis: Non-verbal communication is equally vital in
effective presentations. Using computer vision and emotion recognition
frameworks, SPEAKRAFT tracks facial expressions and evaluates whether they
align with the emotional tone of the content. This ensures presenters engage their
5
audience not only verbally but also through expressive delivery.
By combining these components in an integrated platform, SPEAKRAFT bridges the gap
between global technological innovations and local educational needs. It empowers Sri
Lankan undergraduates to practice, receive constructive feedback, and progressively
enhance their presentation confidence and competence.
